# Documenting Course Progress

## Session: 2023-03-01
Lecture 109, cherry-pick `cfa5cd9` on branch `local-install-gql-auth` (but that is just a straight switch from `local-install-gql-setup` at the previous commit, Lecture 108).
Note: in principle I should just be able to merge these into main and be done with it...in principle...
